//Comment on how to use each declared function, including assumptions (pre-loading data), specify how to call the functions, and including return values

//Comment on each class implementation, how they support the data structure and algorithms used for functions. If a function is modifying data members, it should be outlined in header comments. If it returns info back to client program, document it as well.
